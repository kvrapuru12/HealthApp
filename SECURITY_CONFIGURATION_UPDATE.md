# Security Configuration Update

## Issue Identified
The original implementation had hardcoded request mappings in the controller (`/api/water`) which should be handled by the security configuration instead.

## Changes Made

### 1. Controller Request Mapping
**Before:**
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/water")
```

**After:**
```java
@RequestMapping("/water")
```

**Reason:** Consistent with other controllers in the application (`/steps`, `/sleeps`, `/moods`, etc.)

### 2. Security Configuration Update
**Before:**
```java
.requestMatchers("/steps/**").authenticated() // Allow authenticated access to steps endpoints
```

**After:**
```java
.requestMatchers("/steps/**", "/sleeps/**", "/moods/**", "/water/**", "/food-entries/**", "/activity-entries/**", "/users/**").authenticated() // All health tracking and user management endpoints require authentication
```

**Reason:** Centralized security management for all health tracking endpoints

## Security Configuration Details

### Current Security Rules
```java
.authorizeHttpRequests(authz -> authz
    .requestMatchers("/api-docs/**", "/swagger-ui/**", "/swagger-ui.html").permitAll()
    .requestMatchers("/actuator/**").permitAll()
    .requestMatchers("/health/**").permitAll() // Allow health endpoints
    .requestMatchers("/auth/**").permitAll() // Allow authentication endpoints
    .requestMatchers("POST", "/users").permitAll() // Allow user registration (signup) - should be public
    .requestMatchers("/steps/**", "/sleeps/**", "/moods/**", "/water/**", "/food-entries/**", "/activity-entries/**", "/users/**").authenticated() // All health tracking and user management endpoints require authentication
    .anyRequest().authenticated() // All other endpoints require authentication
);
```

### Endpoints Covered
- `/steps/**` - Step tracking endpoints
- `/sleeps/**` - Sleep tracking endpoints  
- `/moods/**` - Mood tracking endpoints
- `/water/**` - Water tracking endpoints (newly added)
- `/food-entries/**` - Food tracking endpoints
- `/activity-entries/**` - Activity tracking endpoints
- `/users/**` - User management endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `/api-docs/**` - API documentation
- `/swagger-ui/**` - Swagger UI
- `/swagger-ui.html` - Swagger HTML
- `/actuator/**` - Application monitoring
- `/health/**` - Health check endpoints
- `/auth/**` - Authentication endpoints
- `POST /users` - User registration (public)

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Centralized Security Management
- All endpoint security rules are defined in one place
- Easy to maintain and update security policies
- Consistent security across all health tracking features

### 2. Consistent API Design
- All health tracking endpoints follow the same pattern
- No hardcoded `/api/` prefixes in controllers
- Clean and predictable URL structure

### 3. Scalability
- Easy to add new health tracking features
- Security rules automatically apply to new endpoints
- No need to modify controllers for security changes

### 4. Security Best Practices
- Authentication required for all health data endpoints
- Proper separation of public and private endpoints
- Clear security boundaries

## Updated Endpoint URLs

### Water Tracking Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/water` | Create water entry |
| GET | `/api/water/{id}` | Get water entry by ID |
| GET | `/api/water` | List water entries with pagination |
| PATCH | `/api/water/{id}` | Update water entry |
| DELETE | `/api/water/{id}` | Soft delete water entry |

### Example Usage
```bash
# Create water entry
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/water \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 12,
    "loggedAt": "2025-08-14T08:00:00Z",
    "amount": 350,
    "note": "Post-workout hydration"
  }'

# Get water entries
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/water?page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Testing Verification

### Compilation Test
- ✅ All classes compile successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Water tracking tests pass
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Security configuration working correctly

### Security Verification
- ✅ All health tracking endpoints require authentication
- ✅ Public endpoints remain accessible
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes returned

## Conclusion

The security configuration has been properly updated to handle request mapping through Spring Security instead of hardcoded paths in controllers. This approach:

1. **Follows Spring Security best practices**
2. **Maintains consistency across all endpoints**
3. **Provides centralized security management**
4. **Ensures proper authentication for all health data**
5. **Makes the system more maintainable and scalable**

The water tracking functionality is now properly integrated into the security framework and follows the same patterns as other health tracking features in the application.
